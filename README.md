> ü•û ‚òÅÔ∏è A CLI interface for monitoring the state and progress of [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) stacks

## ü§î about

Despite leveraging virtuous a continously deployment model for your application and infrastructure
you may find yourself curious about the current state of your Cloudformation stack. Visiting 
the AWS console can pull you out of your _flow_ using the aws cli can put a strain on your eyes. 
`stack-tail` is meant to fill the cap and draw a quick and clear picture to understanding the state
of your stack.

# üì¶ install

TBD

# ü§∏ usage

This tool communicates with AWS CloudFormation API's using the standard AWS credential chain
to authenticate requests. You may wish to export an `AWS_PROFILE` env variable to query your stacks from different accounts or different regions.

The main usecase for this cli tailing the state of a CloudFormation stack

```sh
USAGE:
    stack-tail [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <stack_name>

FLAGS:
    -f, --follow       Follow the state of progress in changes to a stack until stack completion or failure
    -h, --help         Prints help information
    -r, --resources    Report summarized state for stack resources
    -V, --version      Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -t, --timezone <timezone>    Display timestamps adjusted for the provided timezone.
                                 See list of supported timezones here
                                 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List

ARGS:
    <stack_name>
```

## events

The default view is a list of stack update events

```sh
$ stack-tail my-stack-name
```

## resources

In some cases you may wish to only want to get a picture of the aggregate list of stack resources
you can use the `--resources` or `-r` to get this view

```sh
$ stack-tail -r my-stack-name
```
